Commerce Department EntityMentionSEP	Consumer spending barely edged up in July   the Commerce Department said Friday   as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months .	Q503577	United States Department of Commerce WikiLabelSEP
	Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .		
	Incomes from wages   salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .		
	Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January   when they were flat .		
	Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks .		
	The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June .		
Commerce EntityMentionSEP	""" In July   average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined   more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment   "" Commerce said ."	Q503577	United States Department of Commerce WikiLabelSEP
	But more money went into savings accounts   as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July .		
	That was the highest savings rate since October last year   when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved .		
	The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected .

Wall Street EntityMentionSEP	Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion   significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists .	Q13677	New York Stock Exchange WikiLabelSEP
	That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders .		
	Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July   partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks .		
	In addition   the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth .		
	It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June .		
	Gains in personal income   which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends   interest and businesses   are essential for funding consumer purchases   which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .		
	Spending on all types of durable goods   which includes cars   fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June .		
	But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June   while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion .		
	Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .

( EB ) .	Q7565435 Q11977 Q408 Q36	South African Breweries WikiLabelSEP Tychy WikiLabelSEP Australia WikiLabelSEP Poland WikiLabelSEP

Brazil EntityMentionSEP	The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150 000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994   Farid Hakme   the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP )   said .	Q155	Brazil WikiLabelSEP
