New York City EntityMentionSEP	Nelsonic Industries is the name of an electronics manufacturing and development company that operated from ( New York City ) in the early 1980s and throughout the 1990s when it was acquired by the watch-manufacturer   M.Z. Berger .	NA	k City WikiLabelSEP

	Nelsonic became notable during the early mid-1980s for being the first electronics company in the United States to produce game-watches ( multi-purpose electronic devices capable of functioning as both a time-piece and as a typically electronic game ) .		
	For a period subsequent to its purchase by M.Z. Berger   Nelsonic operated as a subsidiary division of its parent company and game-watches were produced that bore the Nelsonic mark .		
	This practice ended as M.Z. Berger shifted focus to more traditional and higher-end timepieces .		
	Today the original Nelsonic Game Watch line has entered the secondary market and individual Game Watches have become highly sought-after collectibles that often fetch high prices on eBay and other online auction websites .		
	Throughout its existence   Nelsonic produced pop-culture-themed wrist-watches for children and young adults .		
	The chronograph digital watches   typically made of molded plastic   invariably featured an alarm and utilized display-screens to display the time for their wearers .		
	In time the company began manufacturing multi-purpose units that used the LCD screen to combine time display functions with simple video game functions .

	As time progressed   Nelsonic experimented with higher-end products such as metal watches and increasingly complex game-watch designs .		
	In 1990 the watch-making giant   M.Z. Berger   made a large bid and was able to successfully purchase the company .		
	For a period of nearly a decade after this acquisition   M.Z. Berger continued to use Nelsonic as a subsidiary branch and to employ the Nelsonic mark in the release of game-watches and the production of new re-releases of popular models from the 1980s and early 1990s .		
	By the end of the 1990s   however   public interest had waned ( quite possibly due to the rise in popularity of more advanced s and   eventually   of other portable computing devices   such as s and ) and this practice came to an end as M.Z.

	Iowa 's 11th congressional district existed from 1883 to 1933   when Iowa sent eleven congressmen to the United States House of Representatives .		
	The district covered northwestern Iowa .		
	The district was created in 1881 ( effective 1883 ) from a subset of the counties in the old 9th district .		
	From 1883 to 1886   the district included Emmet   Palo Alto   Pocahontas   Calhoun   Greene   Carroll   Sac   Buena Vista   Clay   Dickinson   Osceola   O'Brien   Cherokee   Ida   Monona   Woodbury   Plymouth   Sioux   and Lyon counties .		
	Reapportionment in 1886 reflected the increasing population balance between eastern and western Iowa   causing the district 's size to shrink and resulting in a westward shift of its eastern boundary .		
	No new counties were added   and Emmet   Palo Alto   Pocahontas   Calhoun   Greene   and Carroll counties were moved to the 10th district .		
	After 1886   the boundaries of the district never changed ; the Iowa General Assembly refused to reapportion its districts until the loss of two seats following the 1930 census left the State with no other choice .		
	The district was predominantly rural   except for Sioux City   and included counties such as Lyon that were among the last in Iowa to settle .		
	However   by 1895 the District had the second-largest population of any of Iowa 's congressional districts   behind only the similarly oversized Tenth District .		
	By 1890   the continued disproportionate increase in the population of the Tenth and Eleventh Districts caused some to predict that the General Assembly would need to reduce the area of each district   but no such change occurred .		
	Meanwhile   between 1900 and 1920   the population of Sioux City   exacerbating the problem of underrepresentation .		
	By 1921   the Eleventh District was the most populous Iowa district   with 130 000 more residents than the First District   and over 80 000 more than the population of an ideally-sized Iowa congressional district .		
	All but one congressman elected from this district was a member of the Republican Party .		
	The exception   Democrat Thomas J. Steele   was elected in 1914   when he upset George Cromwell Scott ( who had barely campaigned that year ) .		
	Scott recaptured his former seat from Steele at the first opportunity ( two years later ) .		
	Under the nine-district plan adopted by the Iowa General Assembly in 1931   the boundaries of the old 11th district were preserved as the new 9th district .		
	However   the new 9th district was no longer safe for Republicans   and Democrats and Vincent F. Harrington kept it in Democratic hands .		
	Ten years later   when the 1940 census caused Iowa to lose another seat   the new 8th district included all of the old 11th district 's counties   minus Monona County   which was Democratic-leaning in the 1930s .		
	Republican Charles B. Hoeven won every election in the new 8th district ( and one further election after a round of reapportionment in 1961 combined the 8th district and six more rural counties to form a new sixth district ) .

Judith Lorber EntityMentionSEP	For example   Judith Lorber explains the problem of failing to question dividing people into these two groups “ even though they often find more significant within-group differences than between-group differences . ”	Q1434869	Lorber WikiLabelSEP

	Instead   there is growing support for the possibility of utilizing additional categories that compare people without “ prior assumptions about who is like whom . ”		
	By allowing for a more fluid approach to gender   people will be better able to identify themselves however they choose   and scholarly research will find different similarities and differences .		
	A further issue with the gender binary is the insistence that men are and women are .

	El Madrid de los Austrias ( English : The Madrid of the Austrians or the Habsburgs ) is a name used for the old centre of Madrid   built during the reign of the Habsburg Dynasty   known in Spain as Casa de Austria .		
	The area is located south of the Calle Mayor   in between the stations Sol and Opera .		
	Madrid first became the capital in the 16th century   a period in which Spain experienced its Golden Age .		
	The kingdom underwent enormous economic growth by virtue of its in South America .		
	The Habsburgs commissioned a variety of buildings and infrastructure projects   in order to represent their power and wealth through their shaping of public space .		
	"El Madrid de los Austrias subsequently took the name of its builders   the Spanish Habsburgs   who are known as "" the Austrians "" in Spanish ."		
	Its typical architectural style ranges from the late Renaissance through the early Baroque .		
	The most notable Habsburg construction and the essential part of El Madrid de los Austrias is the Plaza Mayor   in the middle of which stands a statue of its builder   King Philip III .		
	Laid out in 1619   the Plaza Mayor is a large   rectangular plaza with arcades and nine entrances .		
	It is maintained in a colorful dark red and orange ; these colors having been chosen in a city-wide poll .		
	The Plaza Mayor was the scene of bullfights   executions   and coronations .		
	Before becoming the capital   in 1535   the Madrid area was 72 hectares   increasing to 134 in 1565   only four years after the establishment of the Court in the town .		
	At the end of the reign of Philip II   the town occupied 282 hectares and had about 7590 homes   three times more than in 1563 ( 2 250 )   shortly after the appointment of Madrid as capital .		
	The intense housing activity of this period was not sufficient to meet the demand for housing by courtiers and servants of the Crown .		
	This induced the king to issue the edict known as   through which property owners of more than one floor were forced to give one to a family of the court .		
	This decree encouraged the development of what became known as casas a la malicia   a kind of home in which the owners   attempting to avoid compliance with the decree   used different solutions ( a single storey   excessive compartmentalization of the interior or concealment of the upper floor from view from the roads ... ) .		
	The Palacio de Santa Cruz   located on the Plaza de Santa Cruz   was built between 1629 and 1643 .		
	Characteristic of Habsburg architecture is the red facade with white-framed windows and it resembles the style of the Plaza Mayor .		
	The structure has two prominent corner towers with pointed roofs   and originally accommodated a prison   the Carcel de la Corte .		
	Here the condemned would be held before being taken to the adjacent Plaza Mayor for execution .		
	One famous prisoner was the bandit Luis Candelas   a sort of Spanish Robin Hood   who was executed in November 1837 .		
	Despite the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent reconstruction   the palace has lost little of its original form .		
	Briefly hosting the Ministro de Ultramar ( Overseas Ministry )   since 1931 it has been the seat of the .		
	Several important buildings are also located in the Plaza de la Villa   one of the oldest plazas in Madrid .		
	The oldest building is the Torre de los Lujanes   built in the Gothic style in the 15th century .		
	Strictly speaking the Torre does not belong to the Habsburg period   though it is situated in the Madrid de los Austrias .		
	Another building   the Casa de Cisneros   was built in 1537 .		
	Alongside it is the Ayuntamiento   the old town hall .		
	It was built by the architect Juan Goméz de Mora   designer of the Plaza Mayor   and it is architecturally similar with a relatively austere red-orange facade and mansard roof

	Gao Wei ( 高緯 ) ( 557 -- 577 )   often known in history as Houzhu of Northern Qi ( ( 北 ) 齊後主 )   Rengang ( 仁綱 )   sometimes referred to by his later Northern Zhou-created title of Duke of Wen ( 溫公 )   was an emperor of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi .		
	During his reign   Northern Qi 's imperial administration was plunged into severe corruption and wastefulness   with the military suffering after Gao Wei killed the great general Hulü Guang in 572 .		
	Rival Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou launched a major attack in 576   and Northern Qi forces collapsed .		
	Gao Wei   who formally passed the throne to his son Gao Heng   was captured while trying to flee to Chen Dynasty   and later that year   the Northern Zhou emperor executed him and almost all members of his clan .		
	Gao Wei was born in 557   when his father Gao Dan was the Prince of Changguang under Emperor Wenxuan   Gao Dan 's older brother .		
	Gao Wei 's mother was Gao Dan 's wife Princess Hu   and he was her first son   but not his father Gao Dan 's first son -- as Gao Dan 's Lady Li also gave birth several hours earlier on the same day Princess Hu did   to Gao Chuo ( 高綽 ) .		
	However   as Princess Hu was his wife   Gao Dan publicly announced that Gao Wei was born first and treated him as the first-born .		
	Thereafter   he was named Gao Dan 's heir apparent .		
	In 561   another older brother of Gao Dan   Emperor Xiaozhao   died   leaving instructions for the throne to be passed to Gao Dan .		
	Gao Dan therefore took the throne ( as Emperor Wucheng ) .		
	In 562   he created his wife Princess Hu and created Gao Wei crown prince .		
	While Gao Wei was crown prince   he married the daughter of the key general Hulü Guang as his wife and crown princess .		
	In 565   with astrological signs indicating that the imperial position should be changed   Emperor Wucheng 's favored officials He Shikai and Zu Ting   wanting to ingratiate themselves with Empress Hu and Gao Wei as well   suggested that Emperor Wucheng avoid the ill fortune by passing the throne to Gao Wei .		
	Emperor Wucheng agreed   and Gao Wei   at age eight   became emperor   although Emperor Wucheng   carrying the title of ( retired emperor )   retained the actual powers .		
	Emperor Wucheng created Gao Wei 's wife Crown Princess Hulü empress .		
	In spring 567   Gao Wei celebrated his rite of passage .		
	Gao Wei was considered a young man of weak personality   and while Gao Wei was emperor   Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu both greatly favored his younger brother   Gao Yan the Prince of Dongping   honoring Gao Yan with many high offices and making sure that Gao Yan received all of the same supplies as his emperor brother did .		
	"Gao Yan was considered intelligent and decisive   and he once asked Emperor Wucheng   "" My brother is weak in personality ."		
	"How can he lead the empire ? """		
	Both Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu considered deposing Gao Wei and making Gao Yan emperor   but did not actually do so .		
	Around the near year 569   Emperor Wucheng suffered a major illness and died suddenly   after entrusting the important matters to He Shikai .		
	He Shikai   after initially not announcing Emperor Wucheng 's death   did after several days .		
	Retired Empress Hu now carried the title of empress dowager .		
	After Emperor Wucheng 's death   while Gao Wei formally took on imperial authorities himself   the government was led by a group of eight high-level officials -- He Shikai   Lou Dingyuan ( 婁定遠 )   Zhao Yanshen ( 趙彥深 )   Gao Wenyao ( 高文遙 )   Tang Yong ( 唐邕 )   Qilian Meng ( 綦連猛 )   Gao Anagong   and Empress Dowager Hu 's cousin Hu Changcan ( 胡長粲 ) .		
	However   infighting soon developed   as by spring 569   Emperor Wucheng 's cousin Gao Rui ( 高叡 ) the Prince of Zhao Commandery   Emperor Wucheng 's brother Gao Run ( 高潤 ) the Prince of Fengyi   Emperor Wucheng 's nephew Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande   Lou   and Gao Wenyao   were all recommending that He Shikai   who was clearly the most powerful of the eight   be made a provincial governor .		
	Gao Rui   in particular   was most critical of He Shikai for being corrupt and immoral   as it was an open secret that He Shikai was having an affair with Empress Dowager Hu .		
	Faced with the officials ' pressure   He Shikai agreed to be sent out to the provinces ( along with Gao Wenyao )   and it was announced that after Emperor Wucheng 's burial   He Shikai would be made the governor of Yan Province while Gao Wenyao would be made the governor of Western Yan Province ( 西兗州   roughly modern Anyang   Henan ) .		
	After Emperor Wucheng 's burial   Gao Rui pressured He Shikai to leave Yecheng as quickly as possible   despite Empress Dowager Hu 's desire to keep He Shikai for 100 days after Emperor Wucheng 's burial .		
	He Shikai bribed Lou and was permitted to meet Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei once more -- and he persuaded them that the high level officials were intending harm to them and that they could only trust him .		
	Gao Wei thus issued an edict rebuking Gao Rui .		
	When Gao Rui nevertheless entered the palace to try to pressure Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei to remove He Shikai .		
	Empress Dowager Hu   instead   arrested Gao Rui and had the guard commander Liu Taozhi ( 劉桃枝 ) strangle Gao Rui .		
	Thereafter   He Shikai 's power went unchecked .		
	The other favorite associates of Gao Wei -- including Gao Wei 's wet nurse Lu Lingxuan and her son Mu Tipo   as well as Zu Ting .		
	In summer 570   Gao Wei 's concubine Consort Mu Sheli gave birth to his first son   Gao Heng   and Gao Wei declared a general pardon .		
	Lady Lu   who was also Consort Mu 's adoptive mother   wanted Gao Heng to eventually be crown prince and emperor   but was afraid that Empress Hulü would oppose the plan   so she gave Gao Heng to Empress Hulü for her to raise .		
	In winter 570   Gao Wei created Gao Heng crown prince .		
	During much of Emperor Wucheng 's and Gao Wei 's reign up to this point   rival Northern Zhou had gradually encroached on Northern Qi territory   making minor gains on the borders .		
	In winter 570   Hulü Guang launched a counterattack and captured significant amounts of territory north of the Fen River ( 汾水   flowing through modern Linfen   Shanxi ) .		
	He then also defeated Northern Zhou troops at Yiyang ( 宜陽   in modern Luoyang   Henan ) .		
	On his way back to the capital Yecheng ( 鄴城   in modern Handan   Hebei )   Gao Wei ordered his troops demobilized even though many of the soldiers had not received rewards .		
	however   he received an order to demobilize his troops .		
	Hulü Guang submitted a secret petition to Gao Wei   requesting the emperor to send imperial messengers to the army to honor the soldiers .		
	Gao Wei did not act immediately   however   and the army approached Yecheng without receiving any words from the emperor .		
	Gao Wei was displeased that Hulü Guang brought the army close to the capital   and he summoned Hulü to the palace before sending messengers to honor the soldiers and demobilizing them .		
	Later in 571   Gao Wei 's brother Gao Yan   now the Prince of Langye   angry at the hold that He Shikai had on power   killed him   and further mobilized his troops to consider seizing power and killing Lady Lu and her son Mu Tipo   who had also become powerful .		
	Hulü   while he approved of Gao Yan 's killing of He Shikai   was still loyal to the emperor   and he intervened on the emperor 's side   ordering Gao Yan 's troops to disband   and they collapsed .		
	Hulü seized Gao Yan and took him to the palace .		
	At Hulü 's urging   Gao Wei spared Gao Yan initially   although in winter 571 he nevertheless had Liu Taozhi suffocate Gao Yan   and Gao Yan 's four posthumous sons were also killed .		
	Also in winter 571   after discovering that Empress Dowager Hu had been conducting an affair with the monk Tanxian ( 曇獻 )   he executed Tanxian and put Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest   disallowing the nobles from visiting her .		
	"In spring 572   in order to placate her   however   he posthumously honored Gao Yan with the unusual title "" Emperor Gong ' ai of Chu "" and honored Gao Yan 's wife Princess Li "" Empress of Chu . """		
	Zu and Lady Lu tried to have Lady Lu made empress dowager to replace Empress Dowager Hu   but Gao Wei did not do so .		
	Empress Dowager Hu   in order to please her son   summoned the daughter of her brother Hu Changren ( 胡長仁 ) to the palace and dressed her in the best clothes .		
	Gao Wei saw her and was infatuated with her   and he took her as a concubine .		
	In 572   Empress Hulü gave birth to a daughter   and Gao Wei   wanting to please Hulü Guang   initially claimed that she gave birth to a son   but eventually had to admit that the child was a daughter .		
	By this point   Hulü Guang was in serious conflict with the powerful officials Zu and Mu .		
	He disliked Zu   and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals .		
	Once   when he was resting at a governmental building   Zu   who had blinded during a period of imprisonment during Emperor Wucheng 's reign   rode past him without realizing that Hulü was there   and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time .		
	"Hulü angrily stated   "" Who does he think he is ? """		
	Zu   realizing that Hulü disliked him   bribed Hulü 's servant and asked the servant about Hulü 's opinion of him .		
	"The servant stated   "" Ever since you came into power   the Minister Prince [ a reference to Hulü   as Hulü carried the title of Prince of Xianyang ] each night sighed and stated   "" With a blind man in power   the empire will surely be destroyed . """		
	Meanwhile   Mu had once requested to marry Hulü 's daughter by a concubine   but Hulü refused .		
	Further   when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang   Hulü publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army 's horses .		
	Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hulü .		
	They therefore fostered suspicion of Hulü in the emperor 's mind   and that suspicion was exacerbated by the fact that Empress Hulü was not favored by Gao Wei .		
	At the same time   the Northern Zhou general Wei Xiaokuan   wanting to try to exploit Gao Wei 's suspicions   decided to try to create a sense that Hulü would rebel .		
	He wrote two songs in couplets   one of which read :		
	: A hundred sheng [ ( 升   a measurement unit -- and 100 sheng made up one hu ( 斛 ) ) ] will fly up to the heavens  		
	: A bright moon [ ( 明月   mingyue   Hulü 's ) ] will shine over Chang ' an [ Northern Zhou 's capital ] .		
	The other read :		
	: The high [ ( 高   gao ) ] mountain will collapse on its own  		
	: The [ ( 槲   hu ) ] will stand straight on its own .		
	He sent spies to spread the songs near Yecheng   and the songs soon became popular .		
	Zu   exploiting the situation himself   added two more lines :		
	: The blind man will bear a great axe  		
	: The talkative woman will be unable to speak .		
	Both Zu and Lady Lu then reported the song to Gao Wei to further foster his suspicion of Hulü .		
	Gao Wei consulted another favorite   Han Zhangluan   who believed that he should not suspect Hulü   so Gao Wei initially took no action .		
	Zu   however   would not relent   and he had Hulü 's subordinate Feng Shirang ( 封士讓 ) make a secret submission indicating that when Hulü had brought the army close to Yecheng in 571   he was plotting a coup .		
	Gao Wei believed it this time   and under Zu 's suggestion   he awarded Hulü a horse   and then   as Hulü arrived at the palace to thank the emperor   he had Liu Taozhi seize Hulü and strangle him to death .		
	Hulü 's clan was nearly all slaughtered -- including his brother and fellow general Hulü Xian ( 斛律羨 ) and his sons Hulü Wudu ( 斛律武都 )   Hulü Shixiong ( 斛律世雄 )   and Hulü Hengqie ( 斛律恆伽 ) .		
	Only his youngest son Hulü Zhong ( 斛律鍾 )   who was only a few years old   was spared .		
	Empress Hulü was deposed and confined to a subsidiary palace .		
	After Empress Hulü was deposed   Lady Lu wanted Consort Mu to be empress   but Empress Dowager Hu wanted her niece Empress Hu to be empress .		
	She   however   did not believe she had enough persuasive power   and so she had to flatter Lady Lu and give her gifts .		
	Lady Lu also saw that Gao Wei favored Empress Hu   and so agree to jointly suggest   with Zu Ting   that Consort Hu be created empress   and Gao Wei did so .		
	He favored Empress Hu so greatly that he made clothes for her out of pearls   although those clothes were later destroyed in a fire .		
	"However   Lady Lu did not relent in her hopes of making Consort Mu empress   stating to Gao Wei   "" How can a son be crown prince and a mother be a servant girl   a concubine ? """		
	But as Gao Wei favored Empress Hu   she could not carry out her wishes .		
	She therefore engaged witches to use witchcraft on Empress Hu .		
	It was said that within a month   Empress Hu began to show symptoms of psychosis   often mumbling to herself or laughing without cause .		
	Gao Wei began to fear and dislike her .		
	"In winter 572   Lady Lu put Consort Mu in empress clothing and put her in a tent   surrounded with magnificent jewelry   and then told Gao Wei   "" Let me show you a holy woman . """		
	"When Gao Wei saw that it was Consort Mu   Lady Lu stated   "" For a woman this beautiful not to be empress   who would be qualified to be empress ? """		
	"Gao Wei agreed with her   and he created Consort Mu "" Right Empress "" and gave Empress Hu the title "" Left Empress ."		
	Around the new year 573   Lady Lu further falsely told Empress Dowager Hu that Empress Hu had denigrated Empress Dowager Hu 's moral character -- and Empress Dowager Hu   in anger   without verifying the information   ordered Empress Hu expelled from the palace   and then had Gao Wei depose her .		
	Thereafter   it was said that Lady Lu and Mu Tipo were so powerful and so corrupt that they were openly taking bribes and selling the imperial offices   and all that they wished were carried out .		
	"By spring 573   Mu Tipo   Gao Anagong   and Han Zhanglauan were referred to as "" the Three Nobles ""   and they controlled the government ."		
	The issue of corruption became severe   and with Gao Wei himself living in luxury and waste   constantly building palaces and tearing them downand rebuilding them   the Northern Qi imperial treasury was at a state of exhaustion .		
	In spring 573   Gao Wei created Right Empress Mu sole empress .		
	Also in spring 573   Zu Ting   knowing that Gao Wei had a love of literature   with Gao Wei 's approval   established the Wenlin Hall ( 文林館 )   headed by the officials Li Delin and Yan Zhitui ( 顏之推 ) .		
	They retained a group of literarily-capable men and authored one of the great compendia of the era   the Xiuwendian Yulan ( 修文殿御覽 ) .		
	In summer 573   rival Emperor Xuan of Chen launched a major attack across the Yangtze River   commanded by the general Wu Mingche .		
	Gao Wei went against the advice of the officials Wang Hong ( 王紘 )   who advocated passive resistance while reducing tax burdens to strengthen the people 's resolve   and Zhao Yanshan   who advocated commissioning the Liang Dynasty general Wang Lin   who had long wanted to reestablish Liang at Chen 's expense   with an army .		
	Rather   Gao Wei sent reinforcements to the attacked provinces -- but only in small amounts   not sufficient to resist Chen forces -- with the main force commanded by Wei Pohu ( 尉破胡 ) and Zhangsun Honglüe ( 長孫洪略 ) defeated by Wu 's troops .		
	Wang   who accompanied Wei as a consultant   was then ordered to go to Shouyang ( 壽陽   in modern Lu'an   Anhui ) to defend that city against attack -- but with severe limitations on his authority .		
	Soon   Shouyang fell   and Wang was captured and executed by Wu .		
	All of Northern Qi 's territory between the Yangtze and the Huai River fell into Chen control .		
	"Despite the losses   however   Mu Tipo and Han advocated continued epicurean lifestyle on Gao Wei 's and their own parts   with Mu famously stating   "" Even if we lost all territory south of the Yellow River   we can still be like Qiuzi ( 龜茲   a city state in modern Xinjiang ) ."		
	But what is more piteous is that a human life is like borrowed time   and we should use all this short period to seek pleasure .		
	"Why worry about Shouyang ? """		
	Gao Wei agreed   and continued to spend his days feasting .		
	During the Chen attack   Zu   who had become embroiled in conflict with Lady Lu   Mu Tipo   and Han   was expelled from the central government over his attempt to impose a reform regime to streamline the government and reduce expenses .		
	He would not return   and after his departure   the government became even more inefficient than before .		
	Further   also during the campaign   Gao Wei became suspicious of his cousin Gao Changgong ( 高長恭 ) the Prince of Lanling   a capable general   and poisoned Gao Changgong to death .		
	Also during the Chen attack   another major wrongful massacre was carried out at Gao Wei 's orders .		
	Gao Wei was intending to visit the secondary capital Jinyang ( 晉陽   in modern Taiyuan   Shanxi )   which he and his predecessors did on a regular basis .		
	The senior officials Cui Jishu ( 崔季舒 ) and Zhang Diao ( 張雕 ) -- who had been Gao Wei 's teacher previously and respected by him -- believed that for Gao Wei to go to Jinyang would be misinterpreted by the populace as a flight to Jinyang   and would lead to popular panic   so they   with a number of other officials -- including Feng Xiaoyan ( 封孝琰 )   Liu Ti ( 劉逖 )   Pei Ze ( 裴澤 )   and Guo Zun ( 郭遵 ) -- submitted a joint petition requesting Gao Wei to stay at Yecheng .		
	Han suggested that these officials were in fact intending to rebel   and Gao Wei agreed   executing Cui   Zhang   Feng   LIu   Pei   and Guo .		
	He further exiled their clan members   confiscated their women   and castrated their boys .		
	In spring 574   Gao Sihao ( 高思好 ) the Prince of Nan ' an and governor of Shuo Province ( 朔州   roughly modern Shuozhou   Shanxi )   angry that he had been disrespected by Gao Wei 's servant Zhuogu Guangbian ( 斫骨光弁 )   rebelled .		
	Gao Wei sent Tang Yong to resist Gao Sihao while personally leading the next army north   but before he could get there   Gao Sihao was defeated   and he committed suicide by drowning .		
	Meanwhile   around this time   Gao Wei had become less attracted to Empress Mu   instead becoming more infatuated with Empress Mu 's servant girl Feng Xiaolian   making her an imperial consort .		
	They went everywhere together   and they swore to live and to die together .		
	The historian Sima Guang   in his Zizhi Tongjian   had this to say about Gao Wei and his reign :		
	: The ruler of Qi was not a good speaker and could not speak clearly   and so he did not like to meet with governmental officials .		
	He spoke nothing to anyone except his jesters and servants .		
	He was weak in his personality and was fearful of people staring at him .		
	Even the most honored officials or the head of the government were not allowed to look at him   and therefore the officials could only make summary reports and then withdraw in panic .		
	He inherited the luxurious and wasteful living habits of Emperor Wucheng and thought that this was proper .		
	All of the women and eunuchs of the palace dressed in the best silk and ate delicacies .		
	It sometimes took 10 000 pi [ 匹   a measurement unit for textile ] to make one skirt for them .		
	Each of them competed with each other for the newest and most wonderful things   and clothes made in the morning may be considered old and out of style that same evening .		
	He spent much effort on building palaces and gardens of the greatest splendor   but his affections for them could not last   so all buildings were torn down and rebuilt and torn down again .		
	These construction activities went around the clock without ceasing   with great torches used for illumination at night   and water boiled to mix with the dirt in the winter .		
	In order to carve Buddha images in the western hills of Jinyang   over 10 000 torches were used for one night   bright enough to shine on the Jinyang Palace like it was the day .		
	Whenever there were natural disastrous   ill omens   or agrarian rebellions   he never blamed himself   but would only hold great vegetarian feasts to treat the Buddhist and monks   believing that this would bring divine blessings so that difficulties would pass .		
	"He liked to play the pipa and sing   and he wrote a song entitled   Song of No Worries ( 無愁曲 )   with several hundred servants singing with him   leading to the people referring to him as "" the Son of Heaven with no worries . """		
	"He established "" the Pauper Boy 's Village "" within the Hualin Garden ( 華林園 )   where he would put on pauper clothes and beg in the village   believing that this was great joy ."		
	He also built models of the important border cities and had soldiers act like Northern Zhou soldiers to attack them   and with him resisting the attacks with the eunuchs .		
	: His favorite servants Lu Lingxuan   Mu Tipo   Gao Anagong   and Han Zhangluan controlled the government .		
	The eunuchs Deng Changyong ( 鄧長顒 ) and Chen Dexin ( 陳德信 )   and the Xiongnu He Hongzhen ( 何洪珍 ) also participated in the important decisionmaking .		
	Each of them brought their friends and relatives into the government and promoted them beyond proper bounds .		
	The officials ' promotions were all dependent on the amount of bribes they paid ; those who submitted bribes were promoted and those who did not were demoted .		
	The judges issue their verdicts depending on bribes as well   with the rich allowed to live and the poor sentenced to death .		
	The officials compete in their corruption and flattery   to the detriment of the people .		
	The servants   such as Liu Taozhi   were promoted to great honors and created princes .		
	Almost 10 000 of such persons as eunuchs   Xiongnu   singers   dancers   magicians   and slaves   received honors beyond propriety .		
	Hundreds of non-members of the imperial Gao clan received creations as princes .		
	The high rank of Kaifu ( 開府 ) included more than 1 000   and the rank of Yitong ( 儀同 ) was filled innumerably .		
	There were more than 20 generals of the imperial guards .		
	There were tens of imperial attendants .		
	Even dogs   horses   eagles   and hunting cocks received official posts   and were allowed to enjoy the food portions of their salaries .		
	The servants attended the emperor at all times and think of nothing but to please the emperor .		
	A musical can cost over 100 million coins .		
	Later   after the imperial treasury was exhausted   he used the commanderies and counties as awards   giving two to three commanderies or six to seven counties at each time   to allow the servants to auction off the governor and magistrate posts and pocket the proceeds .		
	Therefore   the commandery governors and county magistrates were largely wealthy merchants who find ways to extract and extort from the people   and the people could not live .		
	Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou had long wanted to destroy Northern Qi   and he launched a major attack in fall 575 .		
	Several of his generals suggested attacking Jinyang   but he instead attacked Luoyang .		
	However   when he laid siege to the fortress Zhongtan ( second character not in Unicode )   it was well-defended by the Northern Qi general Fu Fu ( 傅伏 )   and Emperor Wu became ill during the siege and withdrew .		
	During the meantime   however   Chen forces   commanded by Wu   commenced a new attack   putting Pengcheng ( 彭城   in modern Xuzhou   Jiangsu ) under siege .		
	( For the rest of Northern Qi 's existence   however   Wu would not be able to actually capture Pengcheng . )		
	In winter 576   Northern Zhou 's Emperor Wu again launched another major attack on Northern Qi   putting Pingyang ( 平陽   in modern Linfen   Shanxi ) under siege and then capturing it .		
	At the time the news of Northern Zhou 's attack on Pingyang arrived   Gao Wei was hunting at Qilian Lake ( 祁連池   in modern ) with Consort Feng   and Gao Anagong   not believing the matter to be serious   did not report the news to Gao Wei .		
	Only after Pingyang fell did Gao Anagong give Gao Wei the news .		
	Gao Wei gathered his troops and headed for Pingyang   and Emperor Wu   believing Gao Wei 's troops to be still strong   withdrew but put the general Liang Shiyan ( 梁士彥 ) in charge of defending Pingyang against the Northern Qi counterattack .		
	The Northern Qi forces sieged Pingyang with all effort -- and after several days   were able to breach the wall -- but at this point   Gao Wei stopped his attack and summoned Consort Feng so she could witness the fall of the city .		
	When she arrived   however   Northern Zhou forces had already filled in the breach   and therefore held the city .		
	With Pingyang under siege   Emperor Wu launched another attack to try to lift the siege on Pingyang .		
	Gao Anagong advised against direct faceoff with Emperor Wu 's troops   but Gao Wei   egged on by eunuchs   chose to directly engage Emperor Wu   and the armies engaged in a battle around the time of near year 577 .		
	A minor fallback by some of Gao Wei 's troops caused Consort Feng and Mu Tipo to panick   and they suggested an immediate retreat -- and Gao Wei abandoned his troops and fled to Jinyang   causing his army to collapse .		
	Once at Jinyang   instead of preparing for resistance   Gao Wei instead planned to have his cousins Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande and Gao Xiaoheng ( 高孝珩 ) the Prince of Guangning defend Jinyang   planning to himself flee north to Shuo Province   against Gao Yanzong 's advice .		
	He first sent Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Heng to Shuo Province .		
	When Northern Zhou forces arrived at Jinyang   he left Jinyang under Gao Yanzong 's command and fled   initially intending to flee to Shuo Province or   but after persuasion by the general Mei Shenglang ( 梅勝郎 )   headed back to Yecheng   accompanied by Gao Anagong .		
	Meanwhile   Mu Tipo abandoned Gao Wei and surrendered to Northern Zhou .		
	His mother Lady Lu committed suicide   and his family members were all either executed or sentenced to hard labor .		
	Meanwhile   Tang Yong   still at Jinyang   along with other generals   persuaded Gao Yanzong to take the throne himself -- stating to him that if he did not   they could not die for him .		
	"When Gao Wei heard this news   he commented   "" I would rather that Bing Province [ the province containing Jinyang ] fall into Zhou 's hands than Ande 's hands . """		
	Soon   Northern Zhou forces put Jinyang under siege   and they were able to breach the defenses at the east gate -- but a counterattack by Gao Yanzong 's troops lead to a major rout against Northern Zhou forces   in which Emperor Wu almost died .		
	However   Gao Yanzong 's troops went into celebration and could not regroup .		
	The next day   another Northern Zhou attack finally captured the city .		
	Once Gao Wei arrived at Yecheng   he ordered that high rewards be posted for people who would join the army   but he himself was unwilling to contribute treasures from his own palace holdings .		
	Further   when he was giving a speech intending to raise morale   his irreverent attitude instead infuriated the generals .		
	The generals and the officials all lost the will to fight .		
	The official Gao Mai ( 高勱 )   who had escorted Empress Dowager Hu and Crown Prince Heng back from Shuo Province   suggested making one last stand at Yecheng   but Gao Wei did not accept his suggestion .		
	When astrologers indicated that the imperial seat is about to be changed   he decided to pass the throne to Gao Heng and did so in spring 577   even though Gao Heng was only seven years old .		
	Gao Wei himself took the title of Taishang Huang .		
	Gao Wei continued to exercise imperial authority   even though Gao Heng was emperor .		
	He honored his mother Empress Dowager Hu as Grand Empress Dowager   while Empress Mu took the title of empress dowager .		
	Meanwhile   the offiical Moduolou Jingxian ( 莫多婁敬顯 ) and the general Wei Xiangyuan ( 尉相願 ) plotted to try to have Gao Anagong killed   and then declare Gao Xiaoheng emperor   but the plot dissolved when the ambush they set in place for Gao Anagong could not be carried out .		
	Meanwhile   Gao Xiaoheng requested an army so that he could resist Northern Zhou   but Gao Anagong and Han Zhangluan   suspecting him of plotting a coup   sent him out to be the governor of Cang Province ( 滄州   roughly modern Cangzhou   Hebei ) .		
	Meanwhile   Gao Wei   receiving news that Northern Zhou forces were about to arrive at Yecheng   decided to abandon Yecheng and head to the provinces south of the Yellow River to organize a resistance -- but that if the resistance would fail   to flee to Chen .		
	He left the general Murong Sanzang ( 慕容三藏 ) in charge of Yecheng and fled toward Ji Province ( 濟州   roughly modern Liaocheng   Shandong )   where had earlier sent Grand Empress Dowager Hu   Empress Dowager Mu   and the emperor Gao Heng .		
	Once Gao Wei left   Murong Sanzang was unable to defend the city   and it fell .		
	When Gao Wei arrived at Ji Province   he issued an edict in Gao Heng 's name further passing the throne to Gao Wei 's uncle Gao Jie ( 高湝 ) the Prince of Rencheng   sending the edict and the imperial seal to Gao Jie at Ying Province ( 瀛州   roughly modern eastern Baoding   Hebei ) with the official Hulü Xiaoqing ( 斛律孝卿 )   where Gao Jie was governor .		
	However   instead of delivering the edict and the imperial seals to Gao Jie   Hulü surrendered to Northern Zhou .		
	Meanwhile   Gao Wei left Grand Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Anagong at Ji Province while further fleeing with Empress Dowager Mu   Consort Feng   Gao Heng   Han   and Deng Changyu further east to Qing Province ( 青州   roughly modern Qingzhou   Shandong ) .		
	He planned to further flee to Chen   but Gao Anagong   who had been in communications with Northern Zhou forces and was planning to offer Gao Wei as a prize   fed him false information to slow him down .		
	When Northern Zhou forces arrived at Ji Province   Gao Anagong surrendered   allowing Northern Zhou forces to quickly descend on Qing Province .		
	Gao Wei quickly tried to flee   but was captured by the Northern Zhou general Yuchi Qin ( 尉遲勤 ) and delivered back to Yecheng   to Emperor Wu .		
	Emperor Wu initially treated Gao Wei with respect   personally greeting him and treating him as an honored guest .		
	Meanwhile   Gao Jie and Gao Xiaoheng made an attempt to resist Northern Zhou at Cang Province   and when Emperor Wu had Gao Wei send an edict to Gao Jie to order his surrender   Gao Jie refused .		
	However   Emperor Wu 's brother Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi quickly defeated Gao Jie and Gao Xiaoheng   capturing them and largely ending resistance   although Gao Wei 's cousin Gao Shaoyi the Prince of Fanyang ( Emperor Wenxuan 's son ) fled to Tujue   and Tujue 's put Gao Shaoyi under his protection and soon had him declare himself Northern Qi 's emperor   albeit in exile .		
	In summer 577   Emperor Wu returned with Gao Wei   as well as the princes and officials of Northern Qi   putting Gao Wei at the front of the victory procession .		
	He also ceremonially offered Gao Wei and the other captives to the ancestors at the ancestral temple   but did not harm them at this point .		
	He created Gao Wei the Duke of Wen .		
	In winter 577   Emperor Wu   apprehensive of the Gao clan   falsely accused Gao Wei of plotting rebellion with Mu Tipo   and then ordered him and other members of the Gao clan to commit suicide .		
	Only Gao Wei 's developmentally disabled brother Gao Renying ( 高仁英 ) and mute brother Gao Renya ( 高仁雅 ) were spared   but were exiled to modern Sichuan .

	=== Karting ( 1991 -- 2000 ) ===		
	Kovalainen 's career began in kart racing   much like that of many other Formula One drivers .		
	He competed in karting from 1991 to 2000   during which time he finished runner-up in the Finnish championship in 1999 and 2000 .		
	In 2000 he won the Nordic championship and the Elf Masters event   as well as finished third in the World Formula Super A Championship   leading him to be elected as the Finnish Kart Driver of the Year .		
	Kovalainen began his car racing career in the British Formula Renault Championship   which fellow Finn Kimi Räikkönen had won in 2000 before moving straight into Formula One with Sauber .		
	Kovalainen 's apprenticeship in the junior categories of motor sport was more conventional   but he used Renault power at every step along the way .		
	He finished fourth in the championship with two wins   two pole positions   five podiums and three fastest laps   earning the Rookie of the Year award .		
	He also took part in the Formula Three Macau Grand Prix   where he finished eighth .		
	Kovalainen attracted the support of the Renault Driver Development programme and in 2002 moved up to the British Formula Three Championship with Fortec Motorsport who used Renault engines .		
	He became one of the most competitive drivers on the grid by the second half of the season and all five of his wins came in the final nine races .		
	With three pole positions and three fastest laps   Kovalainen finished third overall in the championship behind Robbie Kerr and James Courtney and he was again Rookie of the Year .		
	He also demonstrated strong form in the international non-championship rounds   with second place in Macau and fourth place at the Marlboro Masters at Zandvoort .		
	Kovalainen moved into the Renault-owned in 2003 -- but faced a tough team-mate at the Gabord team in Franck Montagny .		
	Montagny had already spent two seasons in the World Series and had won the championship in 2001 .		
	Montagny won the 2003 title with nine wins to Kovalainen 's one .		
	Kovalainen continued in the series in 2004   but moved to Pons Racing   where he won the championship ahead of Tiago Monteiro   with 192points and six wins .		
	With Kimi Räikkönen finishing seventh in Formula One and Marcus Grönholm fifth in the World Rally Championship   Kovalainen was awarded as the Finnish Driver of the Year .		
	In 2005   Kovalainen entered the GP2 Series   the new ' feeder ' series for F1 and the successor to Formula 3000 .		
	Driving for the Arden International team   Kovalainen began the season with strong results by winning the first round of the championship in Imola and then finishing third in the sprint race .		
	In Barcelona he scored his third consecutive podium   but in the sprint race his car stalled on the grid .		
	He dominated the race in Monaco by claiming pole position   leading the race for the first 21 laps and clocking the fastest lap of the race .		
	Problems during his pitstop   however   dropped him down to fifth .		
	At the Nürburgring he gave his best performance yet   by winning the race from 17th on the grid .		
	In the sprint race José María López caused a collision which forced Kovalainen to retire .		
	At Magny-Cours he won again from fourth on the grid   and came third in the sprint race .		
	At this point in the season   however   a resurgent Nico Rosberg with his ART Grand Prix team seemed to find more speed and began scoring victories   emerging as Kovalainen 's main rival for the championship .		
	Kovalainen and Arden fought back   scoring podiums and points positions in Silverstone   Hockenheim and Hungaroring   but were unable to find the necessary speed to beat Rosberg .		
	In Istanbul 's feature race Kovalainen finished tenth due to engine problems   but in the sprint race held in wet conditions he returned to his winning ways .		
	At Monza Arden were fast again   and Kovalainen snatched his second pole of the season and won the feature race .		
	In the sprint race he could only manage fifth position   however   and this meant that with four races left in the season   Kovalainen was leading Rosberg by only four points .		
	After a chaotic weekend at Spa affected by rain and Safety Cars   Rosberg took the lead from Kovalainen .		
	In the final two rounds in Bahrain   Rosberg and ART seemed to be unmatched again   and he secured the championship by winning the feature race with Kovalainen finishing third .		
	Retiring from the last sprint race   Kovalainen finished runner-up in the series   15 points adrift .		
	=== Renault ( 2004 -- 2007 ) ===		
	Kovalainen   Franck Montagny and José María López tested the Renault R23B F1 car at Barcelona in December 2003 .		
	Kovalainen also tested for Minardi   but Renault made him second test driver alongside Montagny for .		
	Kovalainen was promoted in Montagny 's place at the end of and spent the season in a full-time testing role   logging over 28 000 km of testing .		
	Renault 's lead driver Fernando Alonso had signed for McLaren for the season   and Renault elected to promote Kovalainen in his place   which they confirmed on 6 September 2006 .		
	"Team boss Flavio Briatore said : "" With Kovalainen   I hope to find the anti-Alonso . """		
	Kovalainen made his race debut at the .		
	His season got off to a rough start ; he made several mistakes during the race   finishing tenth .		
	Flavio Briatore felt it was a disappointing debut for the young Finn and hoped the real Kovalainen would show up next time .		
	Kovalainen scored his first World Championship point in his second Grand Prix at Sepang   Malaysia   and followed this with a ninth place in Bahrain .		
	He then secured seventh place in Barcelona   outperforming team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella   but finished down the order in Monaco   in 13th .		
	In Canada he made mistakes throughout practice   including one at the exit of turn 7   and hit the barrier .		
	He crashed at the first chicane in qualifying   and damaged his rear wing significantly   and failed to make it through to the second qualifying session .		
	In the race he made progress early on   and then halted .		
	He had luck with the strategy and the Safety Car   and a podium was within his grasp   but he could not find a way past Alexander Wurz of   who had also started towards the rear of the pack .		
	Kovalainen was pulling away from the Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen in the closing stages   which was a real confidence booster for the team .		
	In the at Indianapolis he qualified in sixth position   and a good start saw him go past Räikkönen into fifth place .		
	He held Räikkönen off   and led the race at the end of his first stint when the cars ahead of him made their pit stops .		
	He re-joined behind Räikkönen and looked comfortable in sixth place until Nick Heidfeld 's BMW Sauber broke down in front of him   and thus   Kovalainen finished fifth   while team-mate Fisichella failed to score points .		
	The second half of the European season failed to produce equally strong results   but it did keep the points tally ticking over .		
	During the at Magny-Cours   he was battling with Fisichella until the sharp Adelaide hairpin   when Jarno Trulli 's Toyota made an optimistic lunge up the inside of Kovalainen which wrecked both drivers ' races .		
	Kovalainen had to pit for repairs and eventually finished 15th .		
	Seventh place at the was no disaster   with Fisichella finishing behind him .		
	Kovalainen scored a point at both the Nürburgring and the Hungaroring   and scored three more in Turkey   with Kovalainen coming ahead of Robert Kubica .		
	Kovalainen again led the Grand Prix when cars ahead of him made their pit stops .		
	Seventh place at Monza was a fair result .		
	The team took a gamble in the next race at Spa-Francorchamps   with Kovalainen on a one-stop strategy while his challengers for the rear end of the points were all on two-stop strategies   which included the BMW 's of Heidfeld and Kubica ( who was docked ten places down the grid due to an engine change )   Nico Rosberg and Mark Webber .		
	A good start from Kovalainen saw him become a mobile chicane for all of them except Webber .		
	The gamble did not pay off   although Kovalainen held off Kubica in the closing stages to secure the final points position .		
	Better was to come at the at Fuji Speedway   where   despite not making it through to the final qualifying session   Kovalainen raced well .		
	While most of his rivals got into trouble one way or another in the hazardous wet conditions   Kovalainen did not and held off Kimi Räikkönen in the closing laps to take second place and his first podium in Formula One .		
	After finishing ninth in the   Kovalainen made a mistake in qualifying in Brazil and was left 17th on the grid .		
	At the start of the race his team-mate Fisichella was involved in a collision with Sakon Yamamoto   which in turn caused Ralf Schumacher to collide with Kovalainen   forcing him to pit .		
	On lap 36 he felt a vibration at the left rear   and suddenly the back end of the car snapped   launching Kovalainen into the barriers .		
	The retirement   possibly caused by damage from the collision with Schumacher   was his first of the season   meaning he lost the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of becoming the first driver to finish all of the races in his first season .		
	As it stands   he shares the record for most consecutive finishes from start of career with Tiago Monteiro   both having finished 16 races .		
	At the end of the 2007 season Fernando Alonso returned to Renault   and Kovalainen was left with offers from Toyota and McLaren .		
	On 14 December 2007 it was confirmed that Kovalainen would replace Alonso once again and drive for McLaren Mercedes in   alongside Lewis Hamilton .		
	Kovalainen joined Keke Rosberg   Mika Häkkinen and Kimi Räikkönen as Finnish drivers that have driven for McLaren .		
	After his first official testing session occurred on 9 January 2008 at Jerez   Kovalainen made his McLaren race début at the   where he was quickest in the first qualifying session and started third on the grid behind Lewis Hamilton and Robert Kubica .		
	He overtook Fernando Alonso on the final lap   but then accidentally hit the pit lane limiter granting fourth place to Alonso   himself finishing fifth   but Kovalainen did set the fastest lap of the race .		
	In Malaysia he was penalised five places for blocking Nick Heidfeld 's in the latter stages of qualifying   dropping to eighth .		
	Kovalainen finished the race third as Hamilton faced problems in the pits   and Ferrari 's Felipe Massa retired due to a spin .		
	In Bahrain he flatspotted a tyre on the first lap and was consequently well off the pace of the Ferraris and the BMW Saubers .		
	Towards the end he improved and recorded the fastest lap of the race again   coming home fifth .		
	At the   Kovalainen had just taken the lead   when his front-left tyre suddenly deflated and his car crashed into the tyre wall on lap 22 .		
	Kovalainen 's car was almost completely buried under the tyres .		
	"The Safety Car was deployed for six laps as the debris was removed   and he was finally removed from the car and placed on a stretcher   at which point he gave a "" thumbs-up "" ."		
	He was then taken by helicopter to a Barcelona area hospital for further tests .		
	His final condition was a minor concussion   whilst also complaining of a sore elbow and neck .		
	"Kovalainen apparently did not lose consciousness at any point   according to the people who assisted him at the scene   but he himself had no memory of the accident nor of giving the "" thumbs-up "" ."		
	The first thing he remembered was waking up at the hospital and the team doctor telling him what had happened .		
	Kovalainen was released from the hospital two days later and he was able to race in Turkey .		
	The cause of the accident was later determined to have been a production error on the wheel rim .		
	In the   evidence of the different driving styles used by the two McLaren drivers became apparent .		
	Hamilton 's more aggressive driving style meant that he had to adopt a three-stop strategy for the race due to concerns over his tyres ' durability at Istanbul Park   while Kovalainen was able to use a two-stop strategy .		
	Kovalainen qualified in second place   but suffered a puncture during a fight with Kimi Räikkönen in the first corner and dropped back to finish the race in 12th place .		
	More disappointment was to follow in Monaco when a software glitch stalled his car on the grid .		
	He was able to start from the pitlane after the mechanics changed his steering wheel   and he made his way up to score a point for eighth place .		
	In Montreal   Kovalainen experienced difficulties with his tyres   as they seemed to degrade much more rapidly than Hamilton 's   and the team was forced to tell him to take it easy in order to avoid a puncture .		
	He finished ninth   and later described his race as a total catastrophe   suspecting the tyre issues had something to do with his driving style .		
	At the Kovalainen started tenth on the grid   after being docked five places for blocking Mark Webber in qualifying   and finished the race in fourth .		
	At Silverstone   Kovalainen achieved his first pole position   and led the race for the first four laps   before Hamilton passed him at Stowe .		
	Despite two spins due to losing grip on the wet circuit   Kovalainen finished fifth .		
	After the race Kovalainen reported similar tyre problems that he suffered in Canada ; after a few laps the rear tyres were completely degraded and had lost their grip .		
	At the Kovalainen finished fifth .		
	In the week leading up to the Hungarian Grand Prix   McLaren confirmed that Kovalainen would remain with the team for .		
	He won his first race at Hungary and became the 100th driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix after race leader Felipe Massa retired due to an engine failure with three laps remaining .		
	"After the race Kovalainen commented : "" In previous races my driving was too hard on the tyres ."		
	"For this race we made somewhat radical changes to the set-up   and they were definitely a step in the right direction . """		
	He finished the following race in Valencia in fourth position   which moved him into the top five in the championship .		
	In September Kovalainen elaborated on the tyre issues for Autosport .		
	The problem seemed to be indeed caused by his different driving style compared to Hamilton   particularly the way he enters corners   uses brakes differently and then accelerates .		
	Hamilton turns the car in a shorter time whereas Kovalainen is trying to make the corners more round   inadvertently causing more wear on the tyres .		
	They had made progress by adapting the car and working on his driving style .		
	In Belgium he qualified third   but lost eight places at the start .		
	On lap ten he collided with Mark Webber and was given a drive-through penalty   which dropped him to fifteenth place .		
	He worked his way back up to seventh   but on the final lap had to retire due to a gearbox failure   which left him outside the points .		
	At the he qualified second behind Sebastian Vettel in the tricky wet conditions .		
	In the race Kovalainen developed brake temperature problems   however   and could not match Vettel 's pace   finishing in second place   but was disappointed at the lost chance for a win .		
	In Singapore   Kovalainen qualified fifth   and tried to overtake Kubica for fourth place at the start of the race   but they made contact at Turn 3   causing Kovalainen to lose two places to Glock and Vettel .		
	During a Safety Car period   both McLarens pitted at the same time and Kovalainen had to queue up behind Hamilton   dropping him down the order to 14th .		
	He ultimately finished tenth .		
	Prior to the Kovalainen discussed his driving style and the tyre problems in an interview with the Finnish newspaper Turun Sanomat   feeling they had now solved the issues .		
	He explained his driving style was now very close to Hamilton 's   as well as his car set-up .		
	Hamilton 's aggressive driving style seemed to work the best with the McLaren MP4-23   allowing the tyres to last longer .		
	Hamilton hits the brakes harder and turns the car more quickly into the corner   while Kovalainen 's softer driving style would be to drive with a longer curve into the corner   going easier on the brakes and accelerating halfway through the corner .		
	Since the McLaren was harder on the tyres than the and the Bridgestones were not quite as robust as the Michelins   that driving style now led to excessive tyre degradation .		
	In Japan Kovalainen qualified third behind Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen .		
	During the initial tussle between Hamilton and Räikkönen   Kovalainen was pushed off the track along with several other cars .		
	Kovalainen was running in third when on lap 17 his car suffered an engine failure .		
	At the on his 27th birthday   he qualified in fifth position despite leading the timesheets in the initial part of third qualifying .		
	In the race   Kovalainen 's first set of front tyres had been marked incorrectly   so the left tyre was installed on the right-hand side of the car and vice versa   meaning the tyres were spinning in the wrong direction   causing understeer .		
	He reported the understeer on the radio   and during his first pit stop the mechanics tried to improve the situation by raising the front-wing angle .		
	Now that he also had correctly marked tyres   however   meant that the front-wing was now causing oversteer and making the front of the car heavier .		
	This possibly caused the puncture to his front right tyre on lap 35   forcing him to pit and drop down to 17th   before he finally retired on lap 49 due to a hydraulics problem .		
	Going into the   Kovalainen qualified fifth on the grid   leading many to believe that the McLarens were fuelled heavier than the other frontrunners   having set the pace earlier in the weekend .		
	Kovalainen eventually finished seventh .		
	At the start of the season McLaren were struggling for pace .		
	Both Kovalainen and Hamilton failed to get into the top ten in qualifying for the first two races .		
	In the   Kovalainen retired due to a collision with Mark Webber in the first corner and in Malaysia he spun off on the first lap while fighting for position with Hamilton and Massa .		
	In China he scored his first points of the season by finishing fifth .		
	McLaren gradually developed the car and results began to improve   with Kovalainen finishing eighth in Germany   fifth in Hungary and his best result of the season   a fourth place at the .		
	This was followed by back-to-back sixth places at Spa and Monza   and seventh in Singapore .		
	He ended the season with 22 points having had five retirements   this left him in 12th position in the championship .		
	On 18 November it was announced that recently crowned world champion Jenson Button had been signed on a multi year deal as Hamilton 's team mate leaving Kovalainen without a 2010 F1 drive .		
	==== 2010 ====		
	It was announced on 14 December 2009   that Kovalainen would drive for Lotus Racing in 2010 along with Jarno Trulli .		
	The team made their debut at the on 14 March 2010 .		
	The car was off the pace in pre-season testing   due to a lack of downforce caused by the need for a conservative initial design .		
	Kovalainen finished in fifteenth position in the race   two laps down on winner Fernando Alonso .		
	In Australia   Trulli did not start the race and Kovalainen finished 13th .		
	In Malaysia   Kovalainen retired with 10 laps to go   and followed this up with fourteenth in China   while in Spain Kovalainen failed to start with problems .		
	He retired in Monaco with steering problems   and in Turkey with hydraulic problems .		
	Kovalainen finished 16th in Canada   2 laps down .		
	At Valencia on lap 9 Mark Webber 's Red Bull hit Kovalainen 's Lotus and went over the top   before landing and skidding into the barrier .		
	Kovalainen recovered to the pits but retired from the race .		
	A 17th place finish at Silverstone and a fourteenth in Hungary sandwiched his fourth retirement of the season in Germany   due to damage caused by a collision with Sauber 's Pedro de la Rosa .		
	He retired yet again at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix after his car caught fire in the final lap   although his decision to not go into the pit lane and instead stop at the side of the track and tackle the blaze himself was met with applause from the crowd .		
	Kovalainen remained with Lotus in .		
	At the season-opening   he was forced to retire after a water leak   before recording his first finish of the season in Malaysia where he finished 15th   before a 16th place finish in China .		
	He finished 19th in Turkey and crashed out in Spain   having started from 15th on the grid   outqualifying the Force Indias of Paul di Resta and Adrian Sutil .		
	He finished 14th in Monaco and 19th at the   with further retirements in Canada and Great Britain .		
	Kovalainen finished 16th at the   before another retirement due to a water leak in Hungary .		
	Kovalainen then finished each of the next five races   with a best placing of 13th at the .		
	He also finished on the lead lap   in 18th place at the   and finished ahead of the Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez in Korea   in 14th place .		
	In India   Kovalainen finished 14th again   running as high as tenth place during the race .		
	During the season   Kovalainen outqualified team-mates Trulli and Karun Chandhok in 17 out of the 19 races held   and Team Lotus principal Tony Fernandes stated that he was satisfied with Kovalainen 's performance over the season .		
	==== 2012 ====		
	Kovalainen was retained by the team -- renamed Caterham F1 for -- for a third year   partnering Vitaly Petrov .		
	This season was more stable   as Kovalainen finished all races but the initial Australian Grand Prix .		
	Kovalainen and Petrov were dropped in favour of Charles Pic and Giedo van der Garde ahead of the season   but Kovalainen remained on good terms with Caterham   attending the Malaysian Grand Prix as a personal guest of Tony Fernandes .		
	Ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix   the team announced that it had re-signed Kovalainen as one of its reserve drivers   replacing and alongside Alexander Rossi   in which role he will take part in the first free practice sessions in Bahrain and Spain .		
	Kovalainen competed in the 2004 Race of Champions at the Stade de France in Paris .		
	In the first two rounds he defeated Formula One drivers David Coulthard and Jean Alesi   and then Ferrari Formula One star Michael Schumacher in a in the semi-finals .		
	"He then beat World Rally Champion Sébastien Loeb in the finals using the Ferrari and a Peugeot 307 WRC car   although Kovalainen had never even sat in a rally car before   to become the first non-rally driver to win the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy and earn the title "" "" ."		
	He also participated in the Nations Cup alongside countryman Marcus Grönholm   but they finished in second place after Kovalainen 's broke down in the finals   losing to the French team of Loeb and Alesi .		
	He returned to the Race of Champions in 2005   defeating Bernd Schneider and Felipe Massa   but was then knocked out in the semi-finals by Tom Kristensen .		
	Kovalainen won the Nations Cup with Grönholm in 2006   but was eliminated in the individual event at the semi-final stage by Mattias Ekström by a mere 0.0002 seconds .		
	In 2007   Kovalainen and Grönholm again made the Nations Cup final   where they lost to the German team of Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel .		
	Kovalainen beat Vettel in the individual race   before crashing on the finish line in the next round against Andy Priaulx .		
	He crossed the line out of control   and Priaulx pipped him .		
	Kovalainen returned to the event in 2010   where he withdrew after suffering a concussion in a crash after a heat race against Sébastien Loeb
